# IdentifyActiveAPIConnections
When you create a connection with a service or system, Logic Apps creates an API Connection that is a separate resource in Azure, when you delete or just stop using an API Connection in your Logic App, the LA does not remove automatically that disconnected API Connection. If you have plenty LAs and API Connections it can be hard to manually identify Connected or Disconnected API Connections from the Azure Portal.  This PowerShell script is for knowing which API connections are in use and which ones are no longer in use.
